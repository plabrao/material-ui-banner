# material-ui-banner
This is a simple Material-UI Banner Implementation. This implementation was made using Type Script.

To call this react project you just need to import it and define one attribute to open and and a function to be called once the button is pressed, like the exemple below:

```jsx
<Banner text='This is the banner message to be showed'open={this.state.showPropPautada} onClose={this.onCloseBannerPropPautada}/>       

```
